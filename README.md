## üß™ Report Overview

### Part 1: Exploring Data and Hypothesis Testing
- Cleaned dataset by checking for duplicates, missing values, and outliers
- Explored distributions of numerical and categorical features
- Formulated hypotheses about performance rating differences between departments
- Used **ANOVA** and **Tukey‚Äôs post-hoc test** to confirm significant differences

### Part 2: Regression Analysis
- Identified **Training Hours** and **Salary** as predictors of performance
- Built and validated a **multiple linear regression model**
- R-squared = **0.823**, indicating strong model fit
- Assumptions of linearity, normality, independence, and homoscedasticity tested and reasonably satisfied
